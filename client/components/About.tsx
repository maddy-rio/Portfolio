        <div className="about-me">
          <p>
            I’m a Dev Academy graduate with a passion for Front-end Development. I love problem solving and am dedicated
            to continuous growth so tech seemed like the perfect place for me to be. I’m a very visual person hence my
            love for the front-end and have a background in customer support which has moulded my ability to understand
            how important user experience is.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about working for a company that makes a difference and contributes to causes close to my
            heart such as animal welfare, women empowerment / getting more women into tech, women's refuge, and causes
            for the less fortunate. I believe in the power of technology to create positive change and am eager to be
            part of such impactful initiatives.
