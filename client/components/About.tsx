      <h1>About TrendyWoofz</h1>
      <div className="about-section">
        <p className="about">
          Hey there! üêæ I'm Maddy, the proud founder of TrendyWoofz, and I'm so
          excited to share my love for dogs through this small business
          adventure. Our mission is simple: to provide gear for your pup that's
          not just practical but also looks cool, feels cozy, and goes the
          distance. That's the vibe we're bringing to NZ!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our go-to walkies essential? The TrendyWoofz harness! Our signature
          harness, designed with a 2-second easy-on system, no-pull D ring, and
          extra padding for comfort, makes walking your woof woof a breeze. But
          it doesn't stop there ‚Äì we've added embroidered name customisation to
          make it uniquely your pup's.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Inspiration has to come from somewhere, and mine has come from the
          love I have for our two family pups, Ollie and Riley. I'm no longer
          living at home, but I try to take them for walks when I can, so I can
          see them in their happy place. I'm currently renting and not allowed
          dogs here, so my biggest goal is to buy our own house, so I can get my
          dream pup, a Golden Retriever. I'm hoping TrendyWoofz can help support
          this dream, so I can have happy wiggly tails at home every day.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Beyond the quality pet gear, TrendyWoofz is also a way to give back. A
          percentage of every purchase goes towards supporting animal charities
          and shelters. Because, for me, dogs are more than just pets ‚Äì they are
          family, and every woof woof deserves a chance at a happy life.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          So, whether you're a dog pro or just getting started, welcome to the
          TrendyWoofz family. Here's to making walks stylish, comfy, and full of
          wiggly tails! üåü
