  <h2 className='page-header'>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a Dev Academy graduate with a passion for Front-end Development. I love problem solving and am dedicated to continuous growth so tech seemed like the perfect place for me to be. I’m a very visual person hence my love for the front-end and have a background in customer support which has moulded my ability to understand how important user experience is. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about working for a company that makes a difference and contributes to causes close to my heart such as animal welfare, women empowerment / getting more women into tech, women's refuge, and causes for the less fortunate. I believe in the power of technology to create positive change and am eager to be part of such impactful initiatives.

    <li><strong>Reformer 🧘🏻‍♀️ -</strong> Reformer pilates is my favourite way to get endorphins flowing in the morning!</li>
    <li><strong>Walks 🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️ -</strong> A cruisy walk along the beachside or under the sun is my jam</li>
